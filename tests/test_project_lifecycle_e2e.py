"""
End-to-end tests for project lifecycle

This module tests the complete project lifecycle:
1. Create a new project
2. Import a source file (samples/sprite_sheet.svg)
3. Verify project directory and files are created
4. Close the project
5. Re-open the project
6. Verify the project loads correctly with the imported source
